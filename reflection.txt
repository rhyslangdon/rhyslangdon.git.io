Reflection:
I have decided to add a second image at the beginning of the website. 
I hope to have animation and links for these photos in the final project. 
I am also working on building a contact form which is in a comment at the bottom of my html.
I've added a link to my photography website which I hope to recreate in the future by myself and integrate it into my web development website. 
I changed the white background to a textured image to make the site more appealing.
The font has also been changed for all titles and headings.
